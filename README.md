# STUSB4500L
USB Type-C Sink controller (5V only)

## STUSB4500L vs STUSB4500
Both devices have the same package and same device ID. But they have one big difference.

- The STUSB4500 is a USB-PD controller, from 5V up to 20V/5A
- Whereas the STUSB4500L is a USB-C controller only (it doesn't support PD), so it is for VBUS = 5V only (up to 5V/3A)
